Hum, I may add a readme before people ask me about this stuff.

So ...

THE README FILE
===============

This is only a proof of concept. It works, but only validates ideas. Nothing
useable for real here.
u
This small piece of codes runs a browser based on the webkit library (safari,
chrome) and runs a script in it. Commands are opan and assert. assert just
matches some text against the full html (yeah, told ya it was a POC).

For now, it will run a browser on a X11 server, execute the script (python
tuple of tuples of script tokens) and show the test result on stdout.

The idea is to use a tester node which can run browsers, with optional external
output, using X11, to do simple functionnal tests from within another
independant software.

INSTALLATION
============
 - needs pygtk-2.0
 - needs pywebkitgtk (latest)

WORK DIRECTIONS
===============

To have a useable software, I need to figure out :
	- how webkit helps me in cookies management
	- how I can have independant sessions (user does something in frontend,
	  admin validates, user come back, etc ...)
	- 1-1 association between some dom and the script string. How can we update ?
		- ex: 
			$('a', 1) => first link on the page. ok but what if we add a link
			before ? how can i find this back in webkit ? how will i write this
			string if user clicks on first link on the page (i mean what does
			webkit expose, in what signal) ? how can i find this from the
			string, and say webkit "click there please" ?

REFERENCE LINKS
===============

Webkit GTK API (C) (no python api, but it's the same, just understand that
python object mappings are translated by (classname)_(method):

HAZARDOUS ZONE (random thoughts)
================================

Don't dream, that's just ideas, not actual work.

   [CI] <-> [WebKit+API]

dv(n) = development boxes
vcs = version control
ci = continuous integration

in sf functional test (or in any other func test framework)

->with('webkitapi-1.0')->begin()
	->do('
		open http://www.google.com/
		assert $title contains "Google"
		click $("a#test")
		assert ...
	')
->end()

version => language version
the tester can be completely bypassed if nor configured, node not available,
specific option used

now the crazy

sf func test:

->with('webkitapi-1.0')->begin()
	->record('182.168.0.11:0') # configure unix DISPLAY to show the recorder
->end()

tester comments the record line, and write generated code (commented maybe, or not, below)
