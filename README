Hum, I may add a readme before people ask me about this stuff.

So ...

THE README FILE
===============

This (very) small piece of code, under 100 lines in the first commit, which was
already running, is:
 - a discovery of python bindings for webkit/gtk (pywebkitgtk).
 - a proof of concept of a way to do functionnal testing using opensource
   browser library webkit.

Understand this is only a proof of concept.

INSTALLATION
============
 - needs pygtk-2.0
 - needs pywebkitgtk (latest)

HAZARDOUS ZONE (random thoughts)
================================

Don't dream, that's just ideas, not actual work.

 dv1 dv2
  |  |
 [ VCS ]
    |
   [CI] <-> [WebKit+API]

dv(n) = development boxes
vcs = version control
ci = continuous integration

in sf functional test (or in any other func test framework)

->with('webkitapi-1.0')->begin()
	->do('
		open http://www.google.com/
		assert $title contains "Google"
		click $("a#test")
		assert ...
	')
->end()

version => language version
the tester can be completely bypassed if nor configured, node not available,
specific option used

now the crazy

sf func test:

->with('webkitapi-1.0')->begin()
	->record('182.168.0.11:0') # configure unix DISPLAY to show the recorder
->end()

tester comments the record line, and write generated code (commented maybe, or not, below)
